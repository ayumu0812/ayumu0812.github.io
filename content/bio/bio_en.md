## Research Focus

Dislocations, a type of line defect in crystals, are known to have electrical properties and degrade the optical and electrical characteristics of semiconductor materials. Therefore, I aim to clarify the electrical properties of dislocations in semiconductors and their mechanisms using Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) STEM, a technique for observing electric fields in materials with a scanning transmission electron microscope.
